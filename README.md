##Introduction
###The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 

##Approaches
###There are multiple approaches implemented for generating Fibonacci sequences:
###Iterative: This approach uses a loop to iteratively calculate Fibonacci numbers.
###Recursive: This approach uses recursion to generate Fibonacci numbers. It is less efficient than the iterative approach due to repeated function calls.
###Dynamic Programming: This approach uses memoization to store intermediate results, making it more efficient than the recursive approach.
